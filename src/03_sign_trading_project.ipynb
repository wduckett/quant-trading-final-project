    "**Overview**\n",

    "This section outlines the end-to-end pipeline for building a machine learning model to predict trade signals based on market microstructure features. The objective is to classify each time step into one of three categories:  \n",
    "- **Buy signal (+1)** → Indicates a likely upward price movement.  \n",
    "- **Hold signal (0)** → No action recommended.  \n",
    "- **Sell signal (-1)** → Indicates a likely downward price movement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We achieve this through feature engineering, time-series cross-validation, model training, and performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1. Future Return Calculation & Signal Labeling\n",
    "To train a classification model, we first compute the **future return** based on the future VWAP and the current price. This helps us create a label for supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Compute the log future return:_\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\text{future\\_return}_t = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{future\\_VWAP}_t}{\\text{price}_t}\\right)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "2. _Classify each time step into buy/hold/sell:_\n",
    "   - A **buy signal (+1)** is assigned if the future return exceeds **mean + std deviation**.\n",
    "   - A **sell signal (-1)** is assigned if the future return is below **mean - std deviation**.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, a **hold signal (0)** is assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "    _Note: there is some look-ahead bias in this approach, since we are using all data to calculate the mean and standard deviation, but we will acception that for this exercise_.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _Remove any missing values** to ensure consistency in modeling._\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2. Machine Learning Model Training\n",
    "We use a **Random Forest Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning to predict future price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing & Feature Scaling**\n",
    "- _Feature Scaling_: Certain features (e.g., `trade_sign`, `spread_Zscore`) do not require scaling, while others benefit from StandardScaler.\n",
    "- _Dimensionality Reduction (Optional):_ If needed, _PCA_ is applied to reduce redundant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time-Series Cross-Validation**\n",
    "Unlike traditional cross-validation, time-series data requires __forward-looking validation_:\n",

    "  - `n_estimators`\n",
    "- The best model is selected based on _**_cross-validation accuracy_.\n",
